My name is Stefan Schlager. Currently, I am working as a researcher at the [University Freiburg](http://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/anthropologie/forschung/angewandte-anthropologie/geometric-morphometrics-and-shape-analysis.html). I would describe myself as a hybrid between a physical anthropologist and a software developer for scientific stuff. I mostly develop in and for R, making use of its flexibility and easy extendability (owed to the great [Rcpp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/) package and its various children).
My main interests are statistical shape analysis (and its application in medical and physical anthropology) and the closely related topics of surface and image registration.
