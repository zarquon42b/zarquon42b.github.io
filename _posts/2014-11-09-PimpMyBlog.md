title: Pimp my Blog&#58; Added zoom effects to images
---

I spent today's siesta break pimping the graphical effects on this blog by adding some javascript snippets I found on the [web](https://github.com/kthornbloom/Smoothzoom).

As suitable for a meta post, the example picture is a screenshot of this post.

<figure>
   <img rel="zoom" src="/resources/images/metaImage.png" alt="bending" width="350" >
  <figcaption"><b>Zoom effect: </b>Click on the image to enlarge it</figcaption>
</figure>
