I'm happy to inform the dear readers of this blog that ***[Rvcg](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rvcg)*** saw a maintenance release (updating the underlying vcglib code) some weeks ago and that both *Morpho* and *Rvcg* are now listed in [CRAN Task Views on Medical Image Analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MedicalImaging.html).
