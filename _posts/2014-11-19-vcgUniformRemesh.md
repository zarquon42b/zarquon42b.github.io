title: Rvcg&#58; New function vcgUniformRemesh
---

I was not content that I had to use an external program to remesh the surface. So I added the function ```vcgUniformRemesh``` that implements uniform mesh resampling from meshlab in Rvcg. To use it, simply update using devtools as described [here](https://github.com/zarquon42b/Rvcg/#installation-of-the-r-package-rvcg-latest-development-code-using-devtools).
