title: ECB - emacs code browser

---

For improving my programming workflow, I was looking for a way to pimp emacs and found [ECB - Emacs Code Browser](http://ecb.sourceforge.net/). This is a handy extension that provides the almighty emacs with a graphical interface for code navigation and overview:

Installation is quite easy:

```
M-x package-install -> ecb
```

Then open a file and activate it with:

```
M-x ecb-activate
```
