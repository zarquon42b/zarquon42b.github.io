title: Install and update all my R-packages using drat
---

To facilitate using in-between CRAN releases for *Morpho* and *Rvcg* and to install and update [mesheR](https://github.com/zarquon42b/mesheR) and [RvtkStatismo](https://github.com/zarquon42b/RvtkStatismo) (and to resolve the interdepencencies between the unofficial packages), I set up a [drat repository](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/drat/index.html).

**CAVEAT**: At the moment this only works for Linux.

## HOWTO use it
The usage is fairly simple.


first install drat:

```r
install.packages("drat")
```

then add my repo:

```r
drat::addRepo("zarquon42b")## this is for the current session only

##Now install mesheR for example
install.packages("mesheR")

##my packages then will also be updated by
update.packages()
```

To add my repository permanently, add ```drat::addRepo("zarquon42b")``` to your *~/.Rprofile* file.
