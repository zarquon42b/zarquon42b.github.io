title: ANTs and meshes (converted to 3D-images)
---

The implementations both of converting a mesh to image data (see [here](/2014/07/16/VTKpandora/) and the [learning of the ANTsR package](2014/07/11/RANTs/) seem pay off: For matching a midfacial region, my surface registration algorithms did not perform too well and I tried the following setup:

* align meshes by landmarks
* create 3D-images
* register images using ANTsR (RANTs)

The initial tests were very promising:

The only drawback is the more time-consuming nature of the matching. The next step is to create an appropriate template.
