title: Initial draft of RvtkStatismo
---

I am currently writing an implementation of the shape modelling library **[Statismo](https://github.com/statismo/statismo)** into R. Now, after a week of nightly madness, I have got somewhat acquainted with **[Statismo](https://github.com/statismo/statismo)** and learned a lot about C++ programming. 
####About RvtkStatismo
The StatisticalModel class is represented in R using an S3 class named "pPCA" and I have provided wrappers from and to statismo. At the moment only the vtkStandardMeshRepresenter is supported and used to map R-objects of class mesh3d (only triangular meshes) and *k x 3* matrices containing coordinates to vtkPolyData. A PDF of the manual generated by calling ```R CMD Rd2pdf``` can be found **[here](../resources/RvtkStatismo.pdf)**. You can obtain the code and detailed installation instructions from **[github](https://github.com/zarquon42b/RvtkStatismo).**
