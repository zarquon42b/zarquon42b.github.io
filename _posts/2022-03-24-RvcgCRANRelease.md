title: New Maintenance Release of Rvcg (0.21) on CRAN
---

Hi everyone,
due to new warnings introduced by the upcoming [GCC 12](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-12/changes.html) compilers I had to update the underlying vcglib headers to the latest version and adapt the C++ parts of [Rvcg](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rvcg) accordingly. There is no new functionality but please test and [report back](https://github.com/zarquon42b/Rvcg/issues) in case anything unexpected happens ;)
