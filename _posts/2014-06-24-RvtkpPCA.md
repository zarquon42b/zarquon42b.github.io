title: Definition of class pPCA in RvtkStatismo
---

I finally made up my mind about the exact contents of the S3 class **```pPCA```**  (see my **[manual]({{site.url}}/resources/RvtkStatismo.pdf)**, page 6).

It is now specified as a list containing the following required entries:

* **```PCA```**: a list containing
    * **```sdev```**: the square roots of the covariance matrixâ€™ eigenvalues
    * **```rotation```** matrix containing the orthonormal PCBasis vectors 
    * **```x```** the scores within the latent space (scaled by 1/sdev) 
    * **```center```** a vector of the mean shape with coordinates ordered    
        
        ```(x1,y1,z1, x2, y2,z2, ..., xn,yn,zn)```
* **```scale```**: logical. indicates whether the data were aligned including scaling

* **```representer```** : an object of class mesh3d or a list with entry **vb** being a matrix with the columns containing coordinates and **it** a 0x0 matrix
* **```sigma```**: the noise estimation of the data
* **```Variance```**: a data.frame containing the Variance, cumulative Variance and Variance explained by each Principal component

And optionally (and missing if data is imported using **```statismoLoadModel```**)

* **```rawdata```**: optional data: a matrix with rows containing the mean centred coordinates in order 
    
       ```(x1,y1,z1, x2, y2,z2, ..., xn,yn,zn)```

I also spent quite some time, ironing out minor flaws and writing documentation.

###TODO:
the class ```pPCAconstr``` should be a either a subclass of ```pPCA``` or removed and replaced by functions manipulating ```pPCA```, which would, however, be less convenient. We'll see..., it is probably the best way to implement the constrained model from statismo first, and then look if things play nicely together.
