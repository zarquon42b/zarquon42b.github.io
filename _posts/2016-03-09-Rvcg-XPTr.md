title: Rvcg&#58; Save and reuse KD-trees using external pointers
---

KD-trees are a fast and reliable method for spatial indexing and closest point searches. In Rvcg, the functions ```vcgKDtree``` and ```vcgClostKD``` provide these functionality, however only returning the result and discarding the KD-trees. For registration processes, the distances are updated in each iteration and it would be sensible to save and reuse the computationally expensive KD-tree setup, especially for large meshes. 

### How to achieve this

The package ***[Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp)***, that is used to exchange data between R and ***[vcglib](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/vcglib/)***, is also sporting external pointers (some sort of smart pointers) that allow to return pointers to objects created by the C++ code and later pass it back and reuse it.
The newly introduced function ```vcgCreateKD``` tree allows to create such an object from meshes and point clouds. Using ```vcgSearchKDtree``` allows to calculated the k-closest neighbours and the respective distances. 
For closest point searches on triangular meshes, this is based on visiting the faces with the k-closest barycenters. Apart from the KD-tree and the corresponding points (the faces' barycenters in this case), we now also need the information of the surface mesh. This can be obtained by the function ```vcgCreateKDtreeFromBarycenters``` and to search it using the function ```vcgClostOnKDtreeFromBarycenters``` can be used.

Below is the speed comparison of  10 closest point searches for 5637 coordinates on a triangular mesh with 564877 vertices and 1127080 faces.

**CAVEAT:** In order to reproduce this, you need to install the xptr branch from Rvcg: ```devtools::install_github("zarquon42b/Rvcg",ref="xptr")```

### Here the results (<a href="#Fig1">Figure 1</a>):

* setting up the kd-tree takes 1.7 secs
* running 10 searches without reusing the KD-tree takes 11.3 secs
* running 10 searches reusing the KD-tree takes 11.3 secs only 3.7 secs


```r
require(Rvcg)
data(humface)
data(dummyhead)
## do a face subdivision to get a mesh with 564877 vertices and 1127080 faces
humfacehigh <- vcgSubdivide(humface,threshold = 0.5,iterations = 8)

tbary <- system.time(kdtreeBary <- vcgCreateKDtreeFromBarycenters(humfacehigh))
print(tbary[3])


tsearch0 <- system.time(lapply(1:10,function(x) test <- vcgClostOnKDtreeFromBarycenters(kdtreeBary,dummyhead.mesh,threads=parallel::detectCores())))
print(tsearch0[3])

## now without reusing the kd-tree
tsearch1 <- system.time(lapply(1:10,function(x) test <- vcgClostKD(dummyhead.mesh,humfacehigh,threads=parallel::detectCores())))
print(tsearch1[3])
