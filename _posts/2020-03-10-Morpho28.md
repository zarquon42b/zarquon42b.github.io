Hi everyone, I am happy to inform you that I uploaded new versions of [Morpho](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Morpho) and [Rvcg](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rvcg) to CRAN that now have been built for all platforms. 


Here is the complete list of changes in the latest Morpho (2.8) and Rvcg (0.19.1) releases


## Morpho 0.28

### New features and bug fixes
 
* NEW: `classify`: added option newdata to predict class affinity for new data

* All rgl related functions: changed mesh coloring to new rgl default of per-vertex color vector
* FIX: `deformGrid3d`: fixed correct position of grid
* FIX: `typprob`: fix mean matrix for single cases
* FIX: `computeTransform`: fix checking for NA Landmarks in all transform types
* FIX: `angleTest`: if values exceed system max for doubles, set them to .Machine$double.xmax and issue warning
