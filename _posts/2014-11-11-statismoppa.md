title: Statismo&#58; install statismo from PPA for Ubuntu 14.04
---

I packaged statismo (0.10.1) for Ubuntu and uploaded it to my [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~zarquon42/+archive/ubuntu/ppa). At the moment I only packaged for Ubuntu 14.04, but if you need it for a different version, drop me a line in the comment section.
Users of Ubuntu 14.04 can install it by issuing the following command in a terminal:


```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:zarquon42/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install statismo

```
